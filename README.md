Using advanced Excel functions, I analyse the data from a multinational Supermarket to get insights on the data

## Average Revenue from sale of Paseo

Using the AVERAGEIF function I calculated the average revenue from the sale of Paseo ($163,421) which was less than the overall average revenue of all sales made (#169,609). This means on average, there were other products that did better in terms of revenue then Paseo.

## Number of sales made in the midsegment and government segments

Using the SUM of COUNTIF function, I estimated the number of sales made in both segments. 
Of the 700 sales made as a whole, over half of them (400) were made in these 2 segments, government and midsegment. 

## Total revenue generated from the sales of montana in Canada

Using the SUMIFS, I solved the above problem with $2,711,919 as the result. 
Upon further analysis I found that the sale of Montana made up 11% of the total sales in Canada. In comparison to the other countries (Germany, France, United States and Mexico), only Mexico had a lower contribution of Montana (9%) to the sales. The sale of Montana contributed 15% each in Germany and United States and 14% in France. 
Therefor, Montana may not be a frequently used product in Canada as compared to the others. 

## Country, Month and Segment in which the highest units of goods were sold

Firstly, using the MAX function I determined the maximum units of goods sold.
Then used VLOOKUP to locate the country, segment and month in which the sales took place. 
For completion sake I also located the product that had the maximum number of units sold at a go.
