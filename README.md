Using advanced Excel functions, I analyse the data from a multinational Supermarket to get insights on the data

## Average Revenue from sale of Paseo

Using the AVERAGEIF function I calculated the average revenue from the sale of Paseo ($163,421) which was less than the overall average revenue of all sales made (#169,609). This means on average, there were other products that did better in terms of revenue then Paseo.
