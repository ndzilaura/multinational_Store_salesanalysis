Using the AVERAGEIF function I calculated the average revenue from the sale of Paseo ($163,421) which was less than the overall average revenue of all sales made (#169,609). This means on average, there were other products that did better in terms of revenue then Paseo.

Using the COUNTIF function, I estimated the number of sales made in both segments. 
Of the 700 sales made as a whole, over half of them (400) were made in these 2 segments, government and midsegment.
